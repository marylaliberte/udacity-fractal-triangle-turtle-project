#this will be in python. I am currently trying to create a fractal triangle with the Turtle class for a project in the Udacity 
#Programming Foundations class. So far I've found out how to draw a triangle and fill it. 
#Next step is to find the midpoint of each triangle and draw another triangle with another turtle. This is the part that's tripping me up

#Current code:

import turtle

def draw_triangle(some_turtle):
    some_turtle.fillcolor("green")
    some_turtle.begin_fill()
    for i in range(1,4):
        some_turtle.forward(200)
        some_turtle.left(120)
    some_turtle.end_fill()

def draw_fractal():
    window = turtle.Screen()
    window.bgcolor("black")

    anthony = turtle.Turtle()
    anthony.shape("turtle")
    anthony.color("green")
    anthony.speed(2)

    draw_triangle(anthony)

    window.exitonclick()

draw_fractal()
